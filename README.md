vim-orogen
==========
A simple ViM syntax file for OroGen specification files used with the [Orocos RTT](https://orocos.org/). Currently it is still WIP and parts of the language may be missing.

Installation
------------
You should be able to install this plugin like any ViM plugin using your favorite package plugin manager. If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) you can simply add the line `Plug 'fglinka/vim-orogen'` between `call plug#begin()` and `call plug#end()` and run `:PlugInstall`.
